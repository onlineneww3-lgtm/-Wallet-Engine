# Wallet-Engine
Wallet Engine is an open and extensible Python engine for working with crypto wallets, designed for developers who need a reliable, transparent, and controllable foundation for building their own wallet solutions, services, and research projects.

The wallet-engine project is being created as an engineering tool, not as a ready-made consumer product. It does not impose specific platforms, blockchains, or third-party services and gives developers complete control over the architecture, logic, and integrations.

🎯 Project goals

The main goal of wallet-engine is to provide a clean and understandable code base that can be used as a foundation for:

developing backend services that work with crypto wallets

creating CLI tools and internal utilities

prototyping wallet logic and experimental solutions

educational and research tasks in the field of blockchain technologies

The project focuses on predictability, code readability, and long-term support, rather than quick or marketing solutions.

🧠 Architectural approach

wallet-engine is built around a modular architecture that allows you to:

isolate critical logic

easily replace or extend components

use the project as a library or as a basis for your own application

Typical module separation includes:

engine — basic wallet management logic

keys — working with keys and cryptographic primitives

storage — abstractions for data storage

interfaces — public APIs for integrations

This approach simplifies testing, auditing, and further development of the project.

🔐 Approach to security

The wallet-engine project is developed with basic security principles in mind, but it is not positioned as a ready-made or certified solution.

The code is open for analysis and audit.

It does not contain hidden logic or external dependencies with unclear behavior.

It does not interact with external services without an explicit connection by the developer.

Responsibility for the final use and integration always remains with the developer.

🐍 Why Python and wallet-engine

Python was chosen as the main language because of:

high readability and transparency

a large number of mature libraries

convenience for rapid prototyping and support

wallet-engine follows Python style and best practices, which makes the project easy to learn, maintain, and extend.

🚀 Who is the project for

wallet-engine will be useful for:

Python developers working with backend systems

engineers creating their own wallet solutions

researchers and enthusiasts of blockchain technology

teams that need a neutral and controllable base without vendor lock-in

⚠️ Important note

wallet-engine is not a user wallet and does not provide financial services.
The project does not store user funds and does not perform operations without explicit code and configuration from the developer.
